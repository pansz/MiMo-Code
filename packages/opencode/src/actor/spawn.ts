## Return format (required)

Your FINAL assistant message — what the spawning agent will receive — MUST start with this header block:

  **Status**: success | partial | failed | blocked
  **Summary**: <one sentence describing what happened>

After the header, include the actual deliverable (whatever the task asked for in its prompt).

If applicable, also include below the deliverable:

  **Files touched**: <comma-separated paths or "(none)">
  **Findings worth promoting**: <bullet list of cross-task transferable facts; "(none)" if just routine work>

This format lets the spawning agent and the checkpoint writer extract your progress without parsing free-form prose. Do NOT precede the header with an introduction — your final message must start with "**Status**:".
